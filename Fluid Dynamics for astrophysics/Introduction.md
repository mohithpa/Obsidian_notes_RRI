# Continuum Hypothesis 
* Unlike classical mechanics wherein we study apply laws to point particles here we consider a continuum of particles and the conservation laws are for point particles.
- We deal with macroscopics rather than microscopics such as pressure.
- Coarse grain description and look at the fuzzier version.
- Bulk properties are charecterized by [[transport coefficients]], like heat coefficient, viscosity coefficient and elasticity coefficient. 

This is the continuum Hypothesis.

- N >> 1 in a reasonable volume 
By reasonable volume we mean some small volume form a given volume; example form $10m^3$ volume $1m^3$ is a reasonable volume and and $1cm^3$ is just too small.
