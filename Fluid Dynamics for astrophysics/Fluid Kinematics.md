It is the study of appearence of motion without really  considering what causes the motion 
## There are two kinds of description in general 
- Eulerian description -> Lab/Field frame , functions(density, velocity etc.) are expressed as F(x,t)
- Lagraingian description -> particle frame you sit on the fluid parcel , if fluid parcel $x_0$ at reference time
   $t=t_0=> F(x_0,t)$
## These frames are related by Galelean transformations

Lagrangian observer $dF =\dfrac{\partial{F}}{\partial{t}}dt + \dfrac {\partial{F}}{\partial{x_i}}dx_i$ (Eulerian observer), $\div$ by dt
$$\dfrac{dF}{dt} =\dfrac{\partial{F}}{\partial{t}} + u_i \dfrac {\partial{F}}{\partial{x_i}}$$
where  $\dfrac{dx_i}{dt}=u_i$
$$\dfrac{dF}{dt} =\dfrac{\partial{F}}{\partial{t}} + (u.\nabla)F$$
$\dfrac{dF}{dt} <=>\dfrac{DF}{Dt}$  is called the material derivative / conductive derivative / substantial derivative / substansive derivative. It is used to distinguish between Eulerian derivative.
