The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) refers to the period in the history of the universe during which the predominantly neutral intergalactic medium was ionized by the emergence of the first luminous sources. These sources may have been stars, galaxies, quasars, or some combination of the above. By studying reionization, we can learn a great deal about the process of structure formation in the universe, and find the evolutionary links between the remarkably smooth matter distribution at early times revealed by CMB studies, and the highly structured universe of galaxies and clusters of galaxies at redshifts of 6 and below. The MWA is designed to provide detailed information on conditions in the intergalactic medium during and immediately preceding the EoR. In particular, Phase II with its two hexagonal sub-arrays with 72 tiles in a regular configuration, is designed to provide the precise calibration and high sensitivity required for this challenging experiment.
