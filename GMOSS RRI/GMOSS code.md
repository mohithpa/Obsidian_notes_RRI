- when I was writing the complex function I see that I had to find the complementary error function which is basically math.erfc() atleast as per what is given in the google but you can also use (1- scipy.special.erfc()) as well to find out the complementary error function. But the value of scipy.special.erfc()(and not 1 - scipy.special.erfc() ) and math.erfc() are the same, which one should I follow
