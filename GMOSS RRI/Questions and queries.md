1) What is convex and concave spectrum here? Resolved 
## questions 21/11/2022
- I have the curve fitting for the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th order polynomial and chi sq was observed to decrease as expected. could you please explain the residual part.
- I did a 2nd derivative test to know if it was a concave or a convex fit. Some values did not match with the paper
- I did not understand how to get p_2, p_3 etc.
- how do I deal with the equations I have at hand.
- may I use the system as the system is in PRATUSH environment
