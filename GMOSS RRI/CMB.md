From Wikipedia [Cosmic Microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#cite_note-1):

In [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") cosmology the **cosmic microwave background** (**CMB, CMBR**) is [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") that is a remnant from an early stage of the universe, also known as "relic radiation". The CMB is faint [cosmic background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_background_radiation "Cosmic background radiation") filling all space. It is an important source of data on the early universe because it is the oldest electromagnetic radiation in the universe, dating to the [epoch of recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_of_recombination "Epoch of recombination") when the first atoms were formed. With a traditional [optical telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_telescope "Optical telescope"), the space between stars and galaxies (the background) is completely dark (see: [Olbers' paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox "Olbers' paradox")). However, a sufficiently sensitive [radio telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope "Radio telescope") shows a faint background brightness, or glow, almost [uniform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic "Isotropic"), that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object"). This glow is strongest in the [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave") region of the radio spectrum. The accidental [discovery of the CMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation "Discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation") in 1965 by American radio astronomers [Arno Penzias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Penzias "Arno Penzias") and [Robert Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Woodrow_Wilson "Robert Woodrow Wilson")was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, and earned the discoverers the 1978 [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics").
