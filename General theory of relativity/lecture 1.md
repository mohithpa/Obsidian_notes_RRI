reference books
1. Schutz, 1st course in gr, take the 2nd edition
2. Meisner Thorne and Wheeler - great reference a bit too much for beginners
3. Wald, terse but complete

structure :
1st half(till spring break) is basically fundamentals of gr and Einstein field equations.
2nd half is applications , black holes etc.

begin special relativity in a form that emphasizes its geometric nature.
- formalism 
- notation,
we will apply strong math to str even though it is not required - squatting a mosquito with a sledgehammer.
first few lectures will be dull.

our setting is in space - time: a <manifold> of events endowed with <metric> 

Manifold : is set or a collection of points with understood connectedness properties.( manifolds of space time, it gives some notion of connects one region to another or one event to another).
More rigorous discussion is carrel pg 54 to 62

Event : when and where something happens(notion of coordinates in space time), coordinates are label attached to events, event is labelled with coordinates 
but the event itself exists independent of labels. 

Metric: metric means to measure, it gives us a notion of distance between events in a manifold, manifold is more primitive than a metric, the geometry gives us the metric, without metric the manifold has no distance encoded in it( carrel and Wald)

so this is our setting, later we will see the notion of metric gives us gravity.

SPECIAL RELATIVITY:

simplest thing of space- time, it corresponds to gr when there is no gravity

key notion of inertial reference frame( follow/refer : Rodger Blandford an Tip Thorne)
- Lattice of clocks and measuring rods that allows us to label and assign coordinates - to any events that happens in space time,
properties:
 1. lattice moves freely through space time(no forces act on it, does not rotate, no inertia)
 2. measuring rods are orthogonal to each other (orthogonal coordinate system)
     spacing between tick marks are uniformly spaced
 3. clocks tick uniformly( no evolution to time standard).
 4. clocks are synced using Einstein synchronized procedure.
     Takes advantage of the fact that speed 
     of light is same to all observers. therefore gives a standard.
     we want to sync two clocks
     $t_{1,e}$ clock 1 emits a pulse of light
     $t_{1,r}$ clock 1 recieves the reflected pulse
     $t_{2,b}$ moment when it bounces back

     idea
     ![[Pasted image 20220616170501.png]]
     this is totally trivial.

when we thow gravity into the mix it becomes very complicated    

UNITS: Choose basic unit of length to be distance that light travels in basic unit of time. If time unit is 1 sec , length unit is 1 light sec, that 300 thousand km, if time unit is 1ns length unit is 1 foot ( within 1% accuracy)
![[Pasted image 20220616171310.png]]
therefore speed of light is essentially 1, when we do this all our philosophis are dimensionless.

Let O is an observer in inertial reference frame (IRF) that was defined a few moments ago, observes events  P and Q
let $\Delta \vec x$ be the displacement is spacetime

![[Pasted image 20220621112101.png]]

component of displacement vector as seen by O ( dot means as seen by O). Then $\Delta \vec x$ as observed by O is defined as

![[Pasted image 20220621112139.png]]

More compact notation

![[Pasted image 20220621112149.png]]

generally indexes tend to be used to label space time indexes, at a particular moment in time you wanna see how space looks like than we use Latin indices, they pick out spatial components in some moment in time.

-   now consider a different inertial observer say he is running at 87% speed of light say the observer is $\bar O$

![[Pasted image 20220621112206.png]]

P, Q and $\Delta \vec x$ are geometric objects that exist independent of the representation. what does change is the representation the observers use.

Now to use greek index notion

![[Pasted image 20220621112229.png]]

![[Pasted image 20220621112305.png]]

$\bar O$ moves with a v along axis 1 with speed v as seen by O,

![[Pasted image 20220621112331.png]]

More compact/better notion is

![[Pasted image 20220621112342.png]]

or even better we can use the einstein summation convention (repeated indices in the upstairs and downstairs position are summer from 0 to 3.

![[Pasted image 20220621112555.png]]

notice that transformation is derivaive of one refereecne frame to another reference frame

![[Pasted image 20220621112613.png]]

the one above is a more general form of the transformation.

Notices how we labelled index was kind of irrelevent

![[Pasted image 20220621112525.png]]

as long as you are summing over it it is irrelevant how you label

![[Pasted image 20220621112508.png]]

the index disappears after our process, as it is just a place holder therefor nu or alpha are just dummy index

![[Pasted image 20220621112450.png]]

$nu \bar $ is free index ( even though they are not exactly free,

last concept :

Space-time vector : any quartet of numbers(components) that transforms b/w inertial reference frames like the displacement vector

![[Pasted image 20220621112433.png]]

It also aother requirement is that it should obey linearity laws

scalar : same to all observers
