### 1st law of thermodynamics
Energy can neither be created or be destroyed they just change forms.

The fist law of thermodynamics:
There can be two reasons for change in the internal energy 
1. The work done
2. The heat energy the flows into or out of the system 
$$\Delta U = \Delta Q + \Delta W$$
