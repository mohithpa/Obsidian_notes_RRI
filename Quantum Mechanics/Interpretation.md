it is statistical interpretation of the wave function that gives quantum mechanics it's structure and meaning because in itself a wave function $\Psi$ is just a function of position x and time t.

- A particle is by it's inherent nature is localized at a point, and wave function is a function that spreads out in space. How can this function represent a particle.
Ans: **Born's statistical** interpretation of the wave function, which says $\Psi^2$ gives the probability of finding the particle

* $\int_a^b |\Psi(x,t)^2|dx =$ **{Probability of finding the particle between a and b at time t}**
* Remember it is a statistical interpretation.
