- Environment shapes the shapes human behavior and habit
- Therefore set your environment properly, keep the book that you want to study in front of you before hand.
- Every habit is context dependent.
- Human's strongest sense is his visions(10 million sensory neurons out of 11 million are for vision) therefore a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do.
- Therefore don't be the victim of your environment be the architect of it.
