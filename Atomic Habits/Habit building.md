### habit stacking 

Diderot's story:

Diderot effect:
* The tendency of one purchase leading to another is called the Diderot effect. The Diderot effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a  spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.

One way to build a new habit is the **habit stacking** regime(just like Diderot story)
* One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current a current habit you already have and stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking
* Habit stacking is a special form of implementation intention
* **Formula: "After [current habit], I will [new habit]"**
example : Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for one minute.
My favorite, : When the phone rings , I will wake up and take one deep breath and smile before answering.
This is how we can exploit the Diderot effect.

**Task to do**:
How to find the right trigger?
Use your habits score card or create a list of two columns:
column 1: habits you do each day without fail Eg:
- Get out of bed
- Take a shower
- Get dressed
column 2: write down things that happen to you every day,
eg:
- The sun rises
- The sun sets
- The phone rings at so and so time
With these lists you can search for the best place to lawyer the habits into your lifestyle.
**Be specific** with habit stacking, i.e. no ambiguity of before or after etc.

The first law of behavioral change is to make it obvious
